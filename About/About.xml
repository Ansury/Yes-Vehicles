   A hopeful succesfull implementation of vehicles into RimWorld!

First off, a big thank you to Jecrell, without him none of you would have this!

This mod is a 'simple' implementation of a truck into our lovely rim world, you can load passengers, as well as equipment for both crossing the map and for caravanning.

To acquire a truck you need to research Machining and Smithing to acquire the Vehicle Table. Here you can construct a box filled with vehicular pieces.
After following guides 1-Z on your ikea manual and throwing away the last 5 screws your pawn will have succesfully assembled a working scrap heap!

Just like any partially oiled machine, youll have to fill and power it with Chemfuel! (not included)

Upon assigning a driver, you must instruct the vehicle to draft itself for glorious duty.

*Disclaimer* If your goal is caravanning, please ensure the loaded driver drives said vehicle to the edge of the map.

Bugs will be plenty in this mod, but hopefully that'll to break your game!
